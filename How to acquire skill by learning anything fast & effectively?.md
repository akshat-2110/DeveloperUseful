## Intro
- I am a Software Developer for more than 5 years now. The work involved in my profession keeps changing in a few years & the work I do is also push me to read many lengthy docs every day. Although my project deadline does not permit me to learn each & every word, concept & mechanism from the doc. And yet I have to build some great thing using those insufficient(i would say not solid) knowledge.
- Apart from this I also want to keep updating my self with new knowledge & skills for my personal development. This doesn't bother me rather I like it cause I am Learning Junkie & I have real learning appetite.
- As per my current job, I am SoC modelling engineer & my day to day work involves reading specification of product which is boring lengthy & not solid. Some time customer did not provide enough information for their safety/proprietary or whatever reason. In this case, we have to guess the functionality on the basis of experience & context in which we are going to use those software products(docs). Moreover, 50% of information is not available on the internet because the thing on which we are working is either proprietary or developing 1st time.
- This scenario gives me the opportunity to find process, tips & tricks on how to learn fast, memorize it for long time & convert it to skill. After going through many TED talks video, Coursera course on Learning how to learn, Reddit & Quora posts, Famous person interviews, here are my observations & learning:

## Learning vs Memorizing vs Skill
- I would define "Learning" a process of acquiring new knowledge.
- "Memorizing" is the process of storing the information in a certain form in our brain. Mind that I have used words "certain form" here because i don't know how information stored in the brain but as per my intellect I can prove that it stored using metadata as we store files in OS. For example, I would ask you "What you ate yesterday in lunch?", you probably have to recall that. But if you found some bug in your rice bowl or something happens with food you were eating, you might remember it nicely without recalling it right now. So that bug or situation is metadata for your information.
- Skill is enforcing acquired knowledge into real life to sick some kind of benefit. 
- Skill is easily distinguishable but people often consider Learning & Memorizing as same.


## Learning faster
- There are no shortcuts believe me. This is the truth.
- Even science proved that when you learn something new it will create/alter neurons structure in your brain. But this structure takes time to strengthen its connection. When you do spaced-repetition, practice or test your self, this connection strengthens over time. This will create a long term memory. And this is the real process of how your brain learns things.
- But yes there are techniques by which you can absorb information plausibly fast & for a longer period of time.
- When you try to learn something the first time, deluge of information coming at you would make the job seem almost impossibly difficult. You will be overwhelmed by the amount of information & your brain is trained in a fashion that it will focus on result directly. 
- In this case, there will be two possibility
  1. Either you procrastinate & focus on other things which will please your mind temporarily.
  2. Or you start with great enthusiasm just by considering result & you left it somewhere in between your struggle.

Default brain reactions: Anxiety, Frustration, Angry & what not.

- Rather what you have to do is 

**Step 0(KICKSTART)**: Just don't think anything, and start doing.

**Step 1(BRIEFING)**: Go through major ideas, key concepts or points quickly. 

**Step 2(CHUNKING)**: Start chunking it and grasp those points/concepts/ideas individually. Also boil down the concept in simple words, sentences or visual image. In order to master a concept, you not only need to know it but also to know how it fits into the bigger picture. There might be a possibility at this point you are not able to see the bigger picture but keep going, move to next chunk.

**Step 3(CONNECTING-DOTS)**: By the end of your all chunk understanding. Your mind automatically tries to connect those chunks with each other and eventually you will get a bigger picture. I am pretty sure all these chunks are connected to each other with some relation, use or context.

This is a very abstract process. There are other parameters which hamper with this learning is like unable to remember, distractions, focus, interest, etc. 

##### Helpers
- Distractions: Do not place your mobile or distracting/addictive thing in front of study material. Use the Pomodoro technique. 
- Procrastination: When facing procrastination, think of process over product. I often procrastinate when I'm overwhelmed by the thought, "Ok, I have to get THIS done". Instead, it can be beneficial to think, "Ok, I will spend an hour on THIS" — which isn't overwhelming, doesn't require a long breakdown of tasks, and gets me started (90% of the battle).
- Interest: There are time you know this is important but you are not interested in it &  for that I have learned from Dr Terrence Sejnowski is that "A good way to pay attention in a boring class is to ask a question - it clears your doubt, it creates a possibly more interesting discussion, it is a more active learning process, rather passive listening"

## Memorizing better

**Step 0(SPACED-REPETITION)**: Outcome of chunking is single abstract word/sentence or visual image. You need to write/store it somewhere and need to revise it over the time. "Why over the time?" is because neural structure takes time to strengthen its connection. This stong connection makes long term memory as I said earlier.

**Step 1(INTERLEAVING)**: Once you have a basic understanding of what you are trying to learn, interleaving can be used to help you master the concepts. By practising jumping back and forth between problems that require different techniques, you can solidify your understanding of the concepts by learning how to choose to apply them in various situations. 

**Step 2(TEST)**: In order to avoid or break through illusions of competence, you should test yourself as you're encountering new material. The recall is a simple example of this mini-testing. So keep testing your knowledge to a different scenario.

##### Helpers
- For spaced-repetition, Flashcards might help(Consider using Anki). Although I use google keep with a reminder once a day and go through words of vocabulary. The visual image will also be much beneficial. 
- Find out the root cause of the problem of why it arose in the first place. Which forms a complete story. As most of the story is divided into three part beginning, struggle & happy-ending. So finding a reason "why we need it?" makes your topic as a story & solution would be a happy ending, trying different things to find a solution to that topic is your struggle. And everybody knows that story is easy to remember.
- Also, try to connect ideas. Though seriously, connecting ideas not only helps you remember them easier (like using landmarks helps prevent getting lost) it also helps you use the ideas more efficiently! You can connect the ideas and have them work together during the problem-solving process.
- Always ask questions like how & why? this will lead you to story or purpose things you are doing right now & help you create long term memory. This is my favourite.
- Handwriting helps you deeply convert what you are trying to learn into neural memory structures. Although this is I have learned but not a fan of.




## Converting to skill
- This is untouched portion no one talks about. Knowing when to apply a particular concept is as important as knowing how.

**Step 0(PRACTICE)**: Practice deliberately on different context/problems.

**Step 1(PLATFORM)**: Find a platform where you can show/grasp related knowledge. Like if you want to learn Spanish, listen to Spanish radio channel participate in Spanish competition. If you want to be skilled in programming practice on HackeRank, HackerEarth kind of platform who provides challenging problems. Talking about it with other peoples interested in the subject (Reddit/Quora/Social-media is useful for that). Hangout with like-minded people.

##### Helpers
- Growth mindset: See your failures as a learning opportunity & analyse others/better solutions. Your errors are sometimes easier to be found by others. So always ask for advice/reviews & be open for the same. Explaining yourself to others, helps you understand more. 
- Illusions of Competence: There are many ways in which we can make ourselves feel like we have "learned" a concept. For example, looking at a solution and thinking that you know how to arrive at that solution is one of the most common illusions of competence in learning. Highlighting or underlining are also techniques that often lead to this illusion of learning. On the other hand, brief notes that summarize keys concepts are much more effective like flashcards. 

##### Confirming acquired skill/concept/learning
- You should be able to visualize it in mind.
- You will be able to teach that thing to a non-technical person.
- You can be able to explain it to someone with a block diagram in 5-10 mins.
- Once you really understand something you can relate it to many things.

## Closing words
- There's a lot of this stuff out there supported by good evidence (and some less so), but unfortunately, most of the best are buried deep in the scientific literature, where it's not super accessible for people busy in day to day life or learning other things.

> **Finally, this is advice I've only taken recently, really pay attention to your mental health. It is really easy to get caught up in the pursuit of knowledge and lose sight of everything else. You can kind of dehumanize everyone else because of views or thoughts that you consider foolish. Before you know it you have isolated yourself from everyone, lost any trace of empathy, and are struggling to maintain normal human relationships now. That last part might be a little too personal to my situation, haha, but you get the idea. - Someone on Reddit**

> **It is inevitable that you will forget the finer details of a large per cent of what you learn, but by discovering how you learn best and teaching yourself the proper techniques you can dramatically lower that percentage and increase your retention as well as the amount of time it takes you to relearn a piece of information. - Someone on Reddit**

- After completion of reading forward, you should learn backward(in reverse order of topics) after sometime or taking break in days.
